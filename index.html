        <h3>I am 16 years old in my life, I play sports and go to basketball courses at my lyceum. I spent half my life
            on
            shooters and various games such as Cs, Minecraft, etc. but after joining the lyceum, I started learning
            English
            and
            began to introduce a normal lifestyle. Obviously, people like me mostly use tobacco products, but in fact I
            am
            not like that and have not used such substances for a long time.</h3>
